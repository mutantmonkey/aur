   AssumeQuality plugin - default quality for tasks
 * (aa3bb37) Correct schema bug[[BR]]
   Can't validate dict keys, so allow any.
 * (61ae896) Update plugin to v1.2.0 compatibility
 * (f787d21) Changed to using 'any' req instead of 'everything'[[BR]]
   Switched to using the real quality component 'any', which allows the[[BR]]
   removal of some special cases. Also tweaked precision().
 * (9dd7269) Documentation updated[[BR]]
   Applies quality components to entries that match specified quality[[BR]]
   requirements.[[BR]]
   When a quality is applied, any components which are unknown in the[[BR]]
   entry are filled from the applied quality. Quality requirements are[[BR]]
   tested in order of increasing precision (ie "720p h264" is more[[BR]]
   precise than "1080p" so gets tested first), and applied as matches are[[BR]]
   found. A pseudo-requirement "everything" is also supported, which will[[BR]]
   match all qualities. Using the simple configuration is the same as[[BR]]
   specifying an "everything" rule.
 * (acb68a3) Improve precision calculation
 * (eb42640) Added advanced usage example
 * (3b1aa47) All rules now tested and applied
 * (6ac5b65) Refactor 'everything' test
 * (423839b) Store rules in sorted list[[BR]]
   Rules are now stored as namedtuples in a sorted list (sorted by[[BR]]
   precision of the rule, see precision()). This allows rules to have[[BR]]
   priorities, currently more specific rule = higher priority.
 * (47091b9) Rule matching now performed
 * (d1a1bdb) Case insensitivity on 'everything'[[BR]]
   Not sure why I wrote the if that way round.
 * (98ac626) Advanced rules now used for default case[[BR]]
   No other rule matching yet
 * (18cf008) Advanced Configuration start[[BR]]
   Plugin now understands advanced configuration in the form of quality[[BR]]
   requirements and qualities to assume if the entry matches them. These[[BR]]
   rules are not yet used for assuming, only tested and stored.[[BR]]
   Also refactored the act of assuming an entry's quality into a separate[[BR]]
   method.
 * (df3eb4a) added underscores to filename & plugin name
 * (481b441) moved to plugins/metainfo
 * (d78aff4) Operate on individual quality components[[BR]]
   Now applies defaults by quality component, so that defaults can be used even if other components are filled by the release.[[BR]]
   For example: "assumequality: 1080p webdl 10bit truehd" and a release flagged 720p h264 is output with "720p webdl h264 truehd"[[BR]]
   Should also handle the addition of more quality components as mentioned in https://github.com/Flexget/Flexget/pull/104#issuecomment-29127271
 * (5d23b7a) AssumeQuality plugin - default quality for tasks[[BR]]
   Many releases no longer explicitly flag 720p, breaking quality filters or requiring complex manipulate setups. This allows a default quality to be applied to entries when none is found.[[BR]]
